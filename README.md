CnCAIEditor
===========

An attempt to create a Tiberian Sun / Red Alert 2 AI Editor, just for fun. If reasonable succesful, it may be released as a download, or first recreated and then released. For the first few commits, don't expect anything useful as this is just me frakking around in WinForms and GitHub.

TODO's and general WiP comments are in Dutch. Finalized comments for everyone are in English. If you don't understand it: don't worry, it's WiP.
